SFMLGame
=========

SFMLGame is a C# architecture-oriented framework based on [Spooker](https://github.com/spooker-dev/Spooker), which is in turn based on [SFML.NET](https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML.Net). However, with little changes, SFMLGame can be laid on top of any C# framework.

Features so far:
- Threaded content loading
- Logging
- Service locator/provider
- Module factory / Dependency Injection container
